# TobeFree

TobeFree is class project develop with 5 other students, we had to create a website for a fictional acupuncture company, this project is focused on the back-end development, all the details are in the pdf file.

This website is running on a local Apache server with a MySQL database. 
We have an MVC pattern with the database, the template generator Smarty and our PHP files.

The website is using url rewritting and routing, which mean olny the index.php is visible from a web-browser and the index will redirect to the other files. It has a login system with connexion and sessions. And you can find some forms to access to the data in the database.
